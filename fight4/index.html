    <div class="description"><p>The newly crowned champion Sean Strickland will be taking on his first title defense against #2 ranked middleweight contender Driscuss Du Plessis. Sean Strickland, a well rounded fighter, had been in the UFC for nearly a decade before he became champion. The fact he got a title shot against Israel Adesanya was considered questionable by many but he was the only fighter that made sense on such short notice. In Strickland's fight against Adesanya, he displayed some of the best defense seen in UFC history. He completely dismantled Adesanya's offense and broke him apart slowly but surely. Adesanya, a fighter who we have never seen outstruck, was beaten not only with strikes, but mentally defeated as well. This leaves most people questioning if Sean Strickland will now become an unstoppable force, or if he just had one good night. Driscuss Du Plessis is a spectacle to many because of his unorthodox style. In most of his fights leading to his match up against Robert Whittaker, he seemed tired (because of a nose issue) and lacked technique. Despite this,  he has finished 5 of his last 6 fights. His last fight being a knockout finish against the #2 ranked Robert Whittaker. From the difference in styles, if Sean Strickland is able to get his momentum early, Du Plessis will surely be unable to start his. Du Plessis is a wild fighter and takes a lot of risks when it comes to his striking. Sean Strickland puts less emphasis on the power behind his punches but rather the placement, timing, and off of his opponents' mistakes. If Strickland applies constant pressure like he did against Adesanya, while staying defensively proficient, Du Plessis will surly be defeated. Placing your money on the -148 favorite, Sean Strickland would be your best chance of a successful bet. </p></div>
