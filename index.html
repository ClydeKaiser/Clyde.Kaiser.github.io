      <h3>LEON EDWARDS VS COLBY COVINGTON</h3>
      <img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/F6hDQCKXAAAAc-0.jpg:large">
      <p>On the entirety of the UFC 296 card, this fight is seen as the most controversial. Paddy Pimblett is a young prospect whose popularity skyrocketed early last year. With his last fight against Jared Gordon at UFC 282, fans and analysts alike are doubting Pimblett's ability to take on real competition. Tony Ferguson, a legend of MMA, hasn't had the glory of victory since June of 2019. Hes amounted 6 straight losses and fans are concerned that he may be suffering from cognitive damage from his extensive career in MMA. Despite this Tony Ferguson is a veteran of the sport and has nothing but difficult competition for the majority of his career in the UFC. With the betting odds making Ferguson a +240 underdog, a bet on him would not be a bad investment, and the payout would make it worthwhile.

      <h2>Place Your Bets</h2>
      <p>When betting on combat sports, you usually want to bet on something that doesn't require too much specifics, since fighting is one of the most unpredictable sports known to man. The safest bet you can make is a Moneyline bet. This best simply is a prediction of who will win or lose. It doesn't get into the specifics of how the person will win, or how many strikes they throw. It's simply who wins the fight. A parlay bet is similar to this method but is adding a more volatile risk of losing money but creating a much higher payout at the same time. When making a parlay bet, you are betting on multiple winners of different fights. If you make five bets and four of your five bets win but one bet loses, you lose the entire bet. A four fight parlay usually payouts 10|1 odds which if you were to win a $100 parlay bet, you would get a return of $1,010. Sports betting odds typically will be in a decimal or positive/negative format. The decimal format is the most basic format in sports betting. A simple example would be if you were to win a $10 bet with 2.00 odds, your final payout would be $20. With positive or negative odds, a( +200)  shows the potential profit on a $100 bet, whereas a negative number (-150) shows how much you need to bet to make $100. </p>
